Spring Boot Starter that bundles opinionated configurations for projects aiming to enhance observability.

== Motivation

Observability is a key aspect of any system, particularly in distributed systems. When building distributed systems, it
can be beneficial to define a common observation setup across multiple projects, such as having a shared tracing
endpoint. This starter aims to provide such a setup as code, following the agile idea of
https://agilemanifesto.org["Working software over comprehensive documentation"].

== Features

=== Common Logback configuration

The starter contains the necessary dependencies for plain console and JSON logging. It also contains a
link:src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[common logback configuration]
which is automatically picked up by Spring Boot applications using this starter.

This configuration offers to ways of logging.

==== Local logging (standard log format)

To enable local logging the Spring Boot profile `local` must be used. In addition to the plain console layout JSON is
written to a local file in `logs/${spring.application.name}.json`.

==== Deployment logging (JSON logs)

If the Spring Boot profile `local` is not active JSON is written to the console.

=== Standard error messages based on RFC 7807

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807[RFC 7807] defines a standard error response format for HTTP APIs.
Spring Boot's
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/annotation/ResponseEntityExceptionHandler.html[`ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`]
is an
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ExceptionHandler.html[`@ExceptionHandler`]
that automatically creates error responses according to that format and is registered as a
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ControllerAdvice.html[`@ControllerAdvice`].
A
link:src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/observability/spring/boot/starter/exception/SimpleResponseEntityExceptionHandler.java[`SimpleResponseEntityExceptionHandler`]
extending ResponseEntityExceptionHandler is automatically registered by this starter (see
link:src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports[Autoconfiguration imports]
and
link:src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/observability/spring/boot/starter/exception/configuration/ObservabilityExceptionConfiguration.java[`ObservabilityExceptionConfiguration`]).

=== Opinionated Spring Boot settings

link:src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/observability/spring/boot/starter/environment/ObservabilityEnvironmentPostProcessor.java[`ObservabilityEnvironmentPostProcessor`]
is an
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/api/java/org/springframework/boot/env/EnvironmentPostProcessor.html[`EnvironmentPostProcessor`]
that automatically suppresses the typical Spring Boot banner during startup.

NOTE: More opinionated settings will be added to the ObservabilityEnvironmentPostProcessor soonâ„¢.

== Usage

=== Common Logback configuration and RFC 7807

The
link:src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[common logback configuration] and the
link:src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/observability/spring/boot/starter/exception/SimpleResponseEntityExceptionHandler.java[`SimpleResponseEntityExceptionHandler`]
are automatically configured once the starter is added as a dependency.

=== Opinionated Spring Boot settings

This starter contains the
link:src/main/java/com/raketeneinhorn/observability/spring/boot/starter/environment/ObservabilityEnvironmentPostProcessor.java[`ObservabilityEnvironmentPostProcessor`]
which is automatically configured in link:src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories[spring.factories].
